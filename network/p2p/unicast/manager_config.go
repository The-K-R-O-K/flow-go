	// StreamZeroRetryResetThreshold is the threshold that determines when to reset the stream creation retry budget to the default value.

	// For example the default value of 100 means that if the stream creation retry budget is decreased to 0, then it will be reset to default value
	// when the number of consecutive successful streams reaches 100.
	//
	// This is to prevent the retry budget from being reset too frequently, as the retry budget is used to gauge the reliability of the stream creation.
	// When the stream creation retry budget is reset to the default value, it means that the stream creation is reliable enough to be trusted again.
	// This parameter mandates when the stream creation is reliable enough to be trusted again; i.e., when the number of consecutive successful streams reaches this threshold.
	// Note that the counter is reset to 0 when the stream creation fails, so the value of for example 100 means that the stream creation is reliable enough that the recent
	// 100 stream creations are all successful.

	//
	// This is to prevent the retry budget from being reset too frequently, as the retry budget is used to gauge the reliability of the dialing a remote peer.

	// Note that the last dial attempt timestamp is reset to zero when the dial fails, so the value of for example 1 hour means that the dialing to the remote peer is reliable enough that the last
	// successful dial attempt was 1 hour ago.
