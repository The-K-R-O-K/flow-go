// ProtocolStateMachine implements a low-level interface for state-changing operations on the protocol state.
// It is used by higher level logic to evolve the protocol state when certain events that are stored in blocks are observed.
// The ProtocolStateMachine is stateful and internally tracks the current protocol state. A separate instance is created for
// each block that is being processed.

	// 'Epoch Fallback Mode' to account for the possibility of system smart contract bugs or systematic
	// bugs in the node implementation. If a state transition is attempted that does not match the
	// implementation's notion of normal operation, it goes into 'Epoch Fallback Mode'. In this state,
	// the network will continue to operate with the last known valid protocol state, but drop any epoch
	// lifecycle events. Ejection events are processed on a best-effort basis, because the network might
	// still need to eject misbehaving nodes despite being in Epoch Fallback Mode.
