readMessages:
This method runs while the connection is active. It retrieves, validates, and processes client messages. Actions handled include subscribe, unsubscribe, and list_subscriptions. Additional actions can be added as needed.

writeMessages:
This method runs while the connection is active, listening on the broadcast channel. It retrieves responses and sends them to the client.

broadcastMessage:
This method is called by each SubscriptionHandler, receiving formatted subscription messages and writing them to the broadcast channel.

pingPongHandler:
This method periodically checks the connection's availability using ping/pong messages and terminates the connection if the client becomes unresponsive.
